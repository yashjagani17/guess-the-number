# guess-the-number
A lightweight Python CLI-based application aimed at guessing a randomly generated number.

## Problem Statement
Build a simple guessing game where the computer selects a random number within a range (e.g., 1–100), and the user has to guess it.

Provide hints (“too high” / “too low”), track number of attempts, and allow replaying.
